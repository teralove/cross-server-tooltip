# cross-server-tooltip

Show tooltips when inspecting gear on cross-server players.

## Notes
+ Show rolls on gear.
+ Many properties are still hidden and cannot be accessed, they include:
    + Item XP
    + Etchings
    + Effect Sets

So remember, a player might have etchings but it will not show in the tooltip!
